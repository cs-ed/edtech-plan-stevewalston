# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology Plan provides the outline for the implementation of a one-year high school computer science course that meets all of the current California Computer Science Standards and is approved as a University of California A-G course.

## Context

### Computer Science

This course is an introduction to many facets of computer science and is intended for students in grades 10 through 12.  Focused on foundational concepts, students will further develop their logical thinking and problem-solving skills.  Upon successful completion of the course, students will understand and/or demonstrate:
  * The importance of Digital Citizenship
    * Cybersecurity
    * Digital Footprint
    * Privacy and Security
    * Information Literacy
  * Cryptography and Encryption Systems
    * History
    * Necessity
  * Networks and the Internet
    * Structure
    * Data transmission
    * Hardware
  * Programming in JavaScript
    * Karel
    * Graphics
    * Control Structures
    * Functions, Events and Lists

### McKinleyville High School

McKinleyville High School is one of two comprehensive high schools in the Northern Humboldt Union High School District which serves approximately ##### students.  McKinleyville High's enrollment is #####.  The county is made up of a patchwork of small, often single school, districts and it is common that families shop around for the schools to attend.  The effect of this is that the enrollment at MHS has been in decline for years, with many students within our boundaries choosing to attend our sister high school due to a larger offering of courses, specifically a robust fine arts and makers program.  In recent years, MHS has added a few new courses such as an architectural design and a culinary class.  One of our goals is to continue to offer new courses that will benefit our current students and attract new ones.

The current enrollment trend highlights one constraint.  After students register for classes, the process of creating a course schedule for the next school year is a complex puzzle.  Many courses such as advanced science and higher level language are only offered once each day so there are often conflicts when trying to find times for elective courses.  The end result is that it is quite possible that students interested in Computer Science would be unable to take the course if the time period conflicts with another they want.

Enrollment aside, there is an additional reason to pursue and promote a course in Computer Science.  Located 5 miles south, Humboldt State University is to become the thrid polytechnic university in the California State University system.  In addtion to the economic and population growth that is expected locally, which could have a positive effect on the enrollment at MHS, the university will add to their course offerings.  There are four proposed new academic programs.  One of the four is Technology, with BS degrees to offered in Data Science, Geospatial Analysis and Software Engineering.  Many of our graduating students attend HSU and a Computer Science at MHS course can introduce students to, build interest in, and prepare students for these new programs.

The NHUHSD has taken proactive measures to maintain facilities and strengthen infrastructure.  The district provides chromebooks for each student and has a dedicated staff to support and maintain district technologies.  Wireless hotspots are available for students living in the remote regions of the district's boundaries.  On both campuses, there is strong wireless access with a dedicated network for the student chromebooks.  The school libraries are popular work spaces and also provide a location for students to wirelessly print school-related content.

Ninth grade students are required to take a one-semester course named Tech Essentials which focuses on keyboarding, word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, report writing and research skills.  The Computer Science course will be open to students in grades 10 though 12 so that students enter into the Computer Science course with the same skills and understanding.  The prerequisite of Tech Essentials in the ninth grade will provide flexiblity to the instructor to delve more deeply into or de-emphasize topics that students demonstrate prior knowledge of.


## Plan

### Software Specifications
*All software is cloud-based and requires an internet connection*

  * CodeHS.com
    * The main source of course content.  Through prepared resources such as video tutorials, example programs, short quizzes and written exercises, students will have interactive and dynamic activities to engage with.  CodeHS further provides offline handouts for additional practice opportunities.

  * Google Workspace for Education
    * Applications such as, but not limited to: Classroom, Slides, Docs and Drive will be utilized for sharing information and for collaboration.

  * Synergy Student Information System
    * The portal for staff, student and parent communication.  This will be used as the online gradebook and the centralized method for communications.
