# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology Plan provides the outline for the implementation of a one-year high school computer science course.  The course meets all of the California Computer Science Standards.

## Context

### Computer Science

This course is an introduction to different facets of computer science and is intended for students in grades 10 through 12.  Focused on foundational concepts, students will further develop their logical thinking and problem-solving skills.Upon successful completion of the course, students will understand and/or demonstrate:
  * The importance of Digital Citizenship
    * Cybersecurity
    * Digital Footprint
    * Privacy and Security
    * Information Literacy
  * Cryptography and Encryption Systems
    * History
    * Necessity
  * Networks and the Internet
    * Structure
    * Data transmission
    * Hardware
  * Programming in JavaScript
    * Karel
    * Graphics
    * Control Structures
    * Functions, Events and Lists

### McKinleyville High School

McKinleyville High School is one of two comprehensive high schools in the Northern Humboldt Union High School District which serves approximately ##### students.  McKinleyville High's enrollment is ####

**Demographics**

The NHUHSD provides chromebooks to each student.  Wireless hotspots are available for students living in the remote regions of the district's boundaries.  On both campuses, there is strong wireless access in classrooms and spaces such as the libraries.  The libraries also provide a location for students to wirelessly print school-related content.

Ninth grade students are required to take a one-semester course named Tech Essentials which focuses on keyboarding, word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, report writing and research skills.  The Computer Science course will be open to students in grades 10 though 12 so that students start the Computer Science course with the same skills and understanding.  The prerequisite of Tech Essentials will provide flexiblity to the instructor to delve more deeply into or de-emphasize topics that students have prior knowledge of.

One constraint that McKinleyville High currently faces is that of making and balancing the master schedule.  Due to the enrollment size and the trend that enrollment has declined in recent years, offering non-required courses is a challenge.  It is quite possible that at this point in time, interested students would be unable to take the Computer Science course if it is offered during the same (and only) time as a required course.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

[ Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services. ]

*All software is cloud-based and requires an internet connection*

  * CodeHS.com
    * The main source of course content.  Through prepared resources such as video tutorials, example programs, short quizzes and written exercises, students will have interactive and dynamic activities to engage with.  CodeHS further provides offline handouts for additional practice opportunities.

  * Google Workspace for Education
    * Applications such as, but not limited to: Classroom, Slides, Docs and Drive will be utilized for sharing information and for collaboration.

  * Synergy Student Information System
    * The portal for staff, student and parent communication.  This will be used as the online gradebook and the centralized method for communications.


### Hardware Specifications

[ Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary. ]

**Teacher**

don't forget to mention the overhead projector

**Student**


### Application

[ Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy. ]

Describe the pedagogy of/from CodeHS

### Impacts

[ How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts. ]
