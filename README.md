# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology Plan provides the outline for the implementation of a one-year high school computer science course that meets all of the current California Computer Science Standards and may be approved as a University of California A-G course.

## Context

### Computer Science

This course is an introduction to many facets of computer science and is intended for students in grades 10 through 12.  Focused on foundational concepts, students will further develop their logical thinking and problem-solving skills.  Upon successful completion of the course, students will understand and/or demonstrate:
  * The importance of Digital Citizenship
    * Cybersecurity
    * Digital Footprint
    * Privacy and Security
    * Information Literacy
  * Cryptography and Encryption Systems
    * History
    * Necessity
  * Networks and the Internet
    * Structure
    * Data transmission
    * Hardware
  * Programming in JavaScript
    * Karel
    * Graphics
    * Control Structures
    * Functions, Events and Lists

### McKinleyville High School

The Northern Humboldt Union High School District serves approximately 1800 students and is comprised of two comprehensive high schools.  On the two campuses there are also two continuation high schools and one charter high school.  McKinleyville High's enrollment is approximately 550 and is the smaller of the two comprehensive high schools.  Of note, the county is made up of a patchwork of small, often single school, districts and it is common that families shop around for the schools to attend.  The effect of this is that the enrollment at MHS has been in decline for years, with many students within our boundaries choosing to attend our sister high school due to a larger offering of courses, specifically a robust fine arts and makers program.  In recent years, MHS has added a few new courses such as an architectural design and a culinary class, though the decline in enrollment continues.  One of our goals is to continue to offer new courses that will benefit our current students and attract new ones.

The current enrollment trend highlights one constraint.  After students register for classes, the process of creating a course schedule for the next school year is a complex puzzle.  Many courses such as advanced science and higher level language are only offered once each day so there are often conflicts when trying to find times for elective courses.  The end result is that it is quite possible that students interested in Computer Science would be unable to take the course if the time period conflicts with another they want.

Enrollment aside, there is an additional reason to pursue and promote a course in Computer Science.  Located 5 miles south, Humboldt State University is to become the thrid polytechnic university in the California State University system.  In addtion to the economic and population growth that is expected locally, which could have a positive effect on the enrollment at MHS, the university will add to their course offerings.  There are four proposed new academic programs.  One of the four is Technology, with BS degrees to offered in Data Science, Geospatial Analysis and Software Engineering.  Many of our graduating students attend HSU and a Computer Science at MHS course can introduce students to, build interest in, and prepare students for these new programs.

The NHUHSD has taken proactive measures to maintain facilities and strengthen infrastructure.  The district provides chromebooks for each student and has a dedicated staff to support and maintain district technologies.  Wireless hotspots are available for students living in the remote regions of the district's boundaries.  On both campuses, there is strong wireless access with a dedicated network for the student chromebooks.  The school libraries are popular work spaces and also provide a location for students to wirelessly print school-related content.

The NHUHSD requires that ninth grade students take a one-semester course named Tech Essentials which focuses on keyboarding, word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, report writing and research skills.  The Computer Science course will be open to students in grades 10 though 12 so that students enter into the Computer Science course with the same (or similar) technological skills and understanding.  The prerequisite of Tech Essentials in the ninth grade will provide flexiblity to the instructor to delve more deeply into or de-emphasize topics that students demonstrate an understanding of.  An additional benefit of opening the course to the tenth through twelfth grades is that students will have completed Integrated Math 1 and will have more practice with logical thinking, problem solving and working with variables

## Plan

### Software Specifications
*All software is cloud-based and requires an internet connection*

  * CodeHS.com
    * The main source of course content.  Through prepared resources such as video tutorials, example programs, short quizzes and written exercises, students will have interactive and dynamic activities to engage with.  CodeHS further provides offline handouts for additional practice opportunities.

  * Google Workspace for Education
    * Applications such as, but not limited to: Classroom, Slides, Docs and Drive will be utilized for sharing information and for collaboration.

  * Synergy Student Information System
    * The portal for staff, student and parent communication.  This will be used as the online gradebook and the centralized method for communications.


### Hardware Specifications

The NHUHSD provides the following for students and teachers:

**Teacher**

Asus ExpertBook
 * Processor: 10th Gen Intel Core i7, 1.8 GHz Quad Core
 * Memory: 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD
 * Display: 14" FHD LED
 * Wireless: Wi-Fi 6 or 802.11ax

Samsung XE310XBA Chromebooks
 * Processor: Intel Celeron, 1.1 GHz
 * Memory: 4 GB RAM, 32 GB SSD
 * Display: 11.6" HD LED
 * Wireless: Gigabit Wi-Fi

### Application

**Communication**

Google Classroom will be used daily to post and maintain a record of the daily topics.  Information about assignments, due dates and methods of submitting deliverables will be addtional elements within each post.  Students will be able to send private messages to the teacher and publish public comments to the class regarding the daily posts.

Students will use other applications in the Google Workspace regularly.  The daily use of school email accounts is expected of all students for receiving school-related information and for communication with teachers and staff.  Google Drive will be actively used as the location to maintain school-related files.  Students will be expected to create Docments, Sheets, Slides, Forms and Groups in their Drive and upload photos or scans of their work to Drive to facilitate the submitting of deliverables.

The district's school information system, Synergy, has been used for years and at this point in time, both students and parents are comfortable navigating within thier respective portals.  Synergy is the central location for all grade-related information and provides another method of initiating email communication.  Teachers regularly use Synergy for sending emails to combinations (whole-class or subgroups) of students and/or parents.  Synergy also provides up-to-date information for staff, academic counselors and administrators regarding student grades and any disciplinary communications with students that teachers log within the portal.
